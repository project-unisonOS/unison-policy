# Security

The policy service is the safety and consent gate for UnisonOS and is expected to run in tightly controlled environments.

For overall security and privacy guidance, including how policy and consent interact with other services, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you discover a security issue in unison-policy, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
